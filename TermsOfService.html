The duty of confidentiality does not apply to the extent that disclosure is necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, in connection with a court application for a preliminary remedy or in connection with a judicial challenge to an arbitration award or its enforcement, or to the extent that disclosure is otherwise required by law or judicial decision.</p><p id="efd766b8-1921-4663-b1a2-31b35231c72c" class="">You and SoundMind agree that for any arbitration you initiate, you will pay the filing fee and SoundMind will pay the remaining JAMS fees and costs.
